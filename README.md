# ffind
ffind uses the 'find' command in Unix/Linux to perform searches for file names that contain a certain word. Currently ffind is limited in it's scope and does not make use of the other features that 'find' offers. But soon those features will be added.

# How to Use:

1. To launch ffind type: sh ffind.sh
2. The prompt will provide four options: (1) basic (2) advanced (3) help (e) exit
3. Basic Search will perform a search starting in your home directory
4. Advanced Search will start the search in any directory you designate
5. Help will give a list of possible advanced search methods. Note 'currently only wildcard is usable'
6. e does not take much explaining, it will exit the program
